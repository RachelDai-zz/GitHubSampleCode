This tool is a private desktop app, can be run in Windows and MacOS. It's for my online taobao shop :) Hence it's only in local language.

I input the order parameters, like color, size, address etc, to convert strings to a jpeg. Then this jpeg can be sent to delivery team to pick up the right item and deliver.

The project was also built into runable jar file.
